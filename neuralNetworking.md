Hello! So here, I am going to give you some introduction about, well, neural networking. 

## Disclaimer! These notes are provided by Brilliant.org. Definitely check them out!

### Introduction to the human brain and neural networking!
The brain contains more than 808080 billion cells — called neurons — which exchange information with one another via small pulses of electricity.

One neuron doesn't talk directly with all 808080 billion others. Rather, they are connected into structures that perform specialized functions. These structures are biological neural networks.

The human brain is too complex to discuss in much detail here, but we don't need to know all the details to land on its most important characteristic — “Brains learn from experience.”

Each time you learn a new game, a dance, or a mathematical skill, neurons in your brain strengthen their lines of communication with some neurons and prune their connections to others.

The structure of a neural network evolves as you gain new abilities.
